The folder consist the MWU algorithm implementation.
The files are as follows:

1. MWU_algorithm.py : the python implementation
2. MWU_algorithm.ipynb : The same code in a ipython notebook format. for review of the code this is much more friendly
3. MWU_algorithm.html : For viewing the use of the code, as a regular web page.

4. GetArm,GetFrames,vectoriz: 3 matlab functions which we use to transfer the data from angles to 2d configurations in space. Will be implemented also in python in near future.

The python code depend on the following packages
using MWU: torch; pandas; numpy; 
comparison for other learner: sklearn
plot: pyplotlib; matlab
